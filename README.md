Modal Popup Project

This project is a simple implementation of a modal popup window using JavaScript and CSS.
The popup window appears when the user clicks on the "Show Modal" button, and disappears when the user clicks on the "Close" button or clicks outside the window.
Usage:
To display the modal popup window, click on the "Show Modal" button. To close the window, click on the "Close" button or click outside the window.
Rules:
1.Only one modal popup window can be open at a time.
2.The user must confirm their choice before closing the modal popup window. 
If the user clicks "Yes" in the confirmation prompt, the window will close. If the user clicks "No", the window will remain open.
